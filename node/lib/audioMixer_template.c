	 *    may be used by any other thread, must synchronize this.
	 * 3. Loop through each slot in soundBites[], which are sounds that are either
	 *    waiting to be played, or partially already played:
	 *    - If the sound bite slot is unused, do nothing for this slot.
	 *    - Otherwise "add" this sound bite's data to the play-back buffer
	 *      (other sound bites needing to be played back will also add to the same data).
	 *      * Record that this portion of the sound bite has been played back by incrementing
	 *        the location inside the data where play-back currently is.
	 *      * If you have now played back the entire sample, free the slot in the
	 *        soundBites[] array.
	 *
	 * Notes on "adding" PCM samples:
	 * - PCM is stored as signed shorts (between SHRT_MIN and SHRT_MAX).
	 * - When adding values, ensure there is not an overflow. Any values which would
	 *   greater than SHRT_MAX should be clipped to SHRT_MAX; likewise for underflow.
	 * - Don't overflow any arrays!
	 * - Efficiency matters here! The compiler may do quite a bit for you, but it doesn't
	 *   hurt to keep it in mind. Here are some tips for efficiency and readability:
	 *   * If, for each pass of the loop which "adds" you need to change a value inside
	 *     a struct inside an array, it may be faster to first load the value into a local
	 *      variable, increment this variable as needed throughout the loop, and then write it
	 *     back into the struct inside the array after. For example:
	 *           int offset = myArray[someIdx].value;
	 *           for (int i =...; i < ...; i++) {
	 *               offset ++;
	 *           }
	 *           myArray[someIdx].value = offset;
	 *   * If you need a value in a number of places, try loading it into a local variable
	 *          int someNum = myArray[someIdx].value;
	 *          if (someNum < X || someNum > Y || someNum != Z) {
	 *              someNum = 42;
	 *          }
	 *          ... use someNum vs myArray[someIdx].value;
	 *
